<p>COBOL, short for COmmon Business-Oriented Language, is a powerful and enduring programming language that has played a significant role in the world of business and finance for several decades. Developed in the late 1950s, COBOL was designed specifically for commercial data processing, making it well-suited for handling large-scale transactions and complex business applications. Despite its age, COBOL remains in active use today, powering critical systems in industries such as banking, insurance, government, and healthcare.

One of the defining features of COBOL is its focus on readability and ease of understanding. The language was designed to be human-readable, employing a syntax that resembles natural language, with words and phrases resembling English. This characteristic makes COBOL highly accessible, particularly for non-technical individuals involved in business operations, allowing them to understand and modify the code more easily.</p>
